## About

* Hi! My name is Carl.
* I'm a recent CS graduate and interested in developing in the fields of cryptography, distributed systems, and machine learning.

## Education

* **The Hebrew University of Jerusalem** 
* B.Sc. in Computer Science

## Projects

* [**Reliability in Distributed Systems**](https://github.com/kqke/RIDS)
* Implementation of a distributed agreement algorithm, and a testing environment. The agreement is between \\( n \geq 2f+1 \\) nodes, able to withstand an adversary capable of causing omission failures to up to \\( f \\) nodes, in an asynchronous environment.  
  
* [**Slither AI**](https://github.com/kqke/AI_slither)
* Implementation of agents using deep Q-Learning (simple neural network and convolutional neural network), for a simplified version of the game "Slither".
